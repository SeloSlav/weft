The site has two faces:

- `Overview`: explains the engine argument and compares it to traditional scatter workflows
- `Playground`: a live WebGPU scene where multiple surface types share the same layout driver and Weft presets

## Core idea

The core idea is simple:

**build reactive surfaces without custom scatter logic**

Most surface systems make you solve placement twice: once to scatter instances, then again to make them react to gameplay. Weft turns that into one layout problem, so the same surface can thin out, open up, heal, or change state without a second bespoke runtime.

Under the hood, the project uses typographic line breaking as the common placement primitive. A surface only needs:

- a glyph vocabulary, or a weighted semantic palette with ids and metadata
- a projection that turns laid-out rows and sectors into world-space instances

Gameplay response then becomes a width problem. Narrow a slot, and fewer glyphs fit. Return zero width, and that part of the surface disappears. Density comes from font metrics rather than hand-tuned scatter constants. Some samples use direct width changes; others keep layout stable and apply deterministic thinning on top.

## SDK

The repo includes these `Weft` layers:

- `weft-sdk/core`: source preparation, deterministic seed cursors, and `SurfaceLayoutDriver`
- `weft-sdk/runtime`: shared recovery/state primitives
- `weft-sdk/three`: Three.js-first helpers plus shipped presets for `grass`, `fish scale`, `rock field`, `fire wall`, and `star sky`

Install the package with Three.js:

```bash
npm install weft-sdk three
```

`three` is a peer dependency. `@chenglou/pretext` is bundled as a normal dependency of `weft-sdk`.

The SDK already supports a direct authoring path for new effects through source creation, layout helpers, behaviors, and presets:

```ts
import {
  DEFAULT_GRASS_FIELD_PARAMS,
  createGrassEffect,
  createSurfaceSource,
} from 'weft-sdk/three'
import { seedCursor } from 'weft-sdk/core'

const surface = createSurfaceSource({
  cacheKey: 'my-surface',
  units: ['◓', '◒', '◐', '◑'],
  repeat: 22,
})

const grass = createGrassEffect({
  seedCursor,
  surface,
  initialParams: DEFAULT_GRASS_FIELD_PARAMS,
})
```

Shipped preset entrypoints:

- `createGrassEffect()`
- `createFishScaleEffect()`
- `createRockFieldEffect()`
- `createFireWallEffect()`
- `createStarSkyEffect()`

## Current playground

The current `Editor` is no longer a single fish demo. It hosts one shared runtime scene with controls for:

- grass field: trampling, disturbance radius, wind, seasonal palette, density, recovery
- fish wall: wound radius, retained width, crater depth, scale lift, surface flex, recovery
- rock field: layout density and overall rock scale
- fire wall: bullet-hole size and recovery
- star sky: density and sky-wound recovery
- scene actions: clear grass, fish wall, fire, sky, or everything at once

All of those surfaces are mounted together inside one plain TypeScript `PlaygroundRuntime`, and the playground now instantiates them through `src/weft/three` rather than bespoke sample classes.

## Runtime interaction

In the current playground:

- `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` move
- `Shift` sprints
- `Space` jumps
- right mouse drag looks around
- mouse wheel zooms
- left click shoots the reticle target

Shots affect the world based on what is under the reticle:

- grass gets local disturbance
- the fish wall gets persistent wounds
- the fire wall gets punched holes
- the sky can be wounded when you shoot upward past world geometry

## How it is built

The architecture is intentionally split so the engine idea is not coupled to React:

- React is only the site shell, landing page, and control UI
- `Three.js` + `WebGPU` run the renderer
- the runtime is plain TypeScript, which keeps the layout system portable and suited to live surface updates
- `src/weft/core` handles source preparation, deterministic band seeding, and layout traversal
- [`Pretext`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chenglou/pretext) provides the underlying measurement and line breaking

At a high level the pipeline is:

1. Prepare a measured glyph stream with Weft core on top of Pretext.
2. Describe a surface as rows, sectors, and available width.
3. Run deterministic layout with seeded cursors.
4. Project laid-out glyphs into world-space instances.
5. Re-run layout or thinning when gameplay changes the width field.

## Run the playground

Node.js 20+ is recommended.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open the Vite URL in a **WebGPU-capable browser**.

Important:

- this playground is WebGPU-only
- Three.js WebGL fallback is intentionally disabled
- if WebGPU is unavailable, the app should fail clearly instead of silently switching renderers

Production build:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## What this repo is

- a working Three.js-first SDK for reactive surface layout
- a playground for comparing multiple surface types under one API
- a proof that gameplay-driven density can come from layout instead of scatter rebuilds
